=================

This is really stupid.

## Running the game

Put files in a folder. Run. That's it! 

(Only tested in Chrome.)

## Controls

### Movement

Use the mouse to move the wonky spaceship.

### Shooting red rockets

Use the left mouse button to shoot rockets at green enemies.

### Spawning enemies

If you have a middle mouse button use it to spawn enemies. Or wait for them to spawn. They will kill you eventually though.
